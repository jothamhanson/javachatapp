#  JavaFX Chat Application

#### ummm... this is a simple **JavaFX-based chat application** that supports real-time messaging using **MongoDB** as the backend database.  
 #### It has user authentication, chatroom creation between two users, and  UI rendering with message bubbles.

##  Features

-  **User List** — Loads all registered users from MongoDB asynchronously.  
-  **Chat Rooms** — chatrooms are created with the combination of the sender and receiver usernames
 ( `spiderman+hulk` is `hulk+spiderman`).  
-  **Message Bubbles** — Displays messages with timestamps aligned  on sender.  
-  **MongoDB Storage** — Messages and users are stored in a MongoDB database.  
-  **Asynchronous Operations** — Database calls run on background threads.  
-  **UI** — Built with JavaFX.
